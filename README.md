# todo
* Version 1 creates base todo app, however it is too simple.
* Version 2 adds the ability to save to and load from a file, however it suffers with long or multi-line tasks.
* Version 3 adds the ability to complete or delete a task by number, however it is not ready to connect to a cloud database.
