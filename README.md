# todo
* Version 1 creates base todo app, however it is too simple.
* Version 2 adds the ability to save to and load from a file, however it suffers with long or multi-line tasks.
* Version 3 adds the ability to complete or delete a task by number, however it is not ready to connect to a cloud database.
* Version 4 works on my website and only uses functions to update a list that you can upload or download
* Version 5 is a work in progress for it to be a desktop application that works on linux and macOS with a gui. Includes level up progress bar and is supposed to have a background image.
